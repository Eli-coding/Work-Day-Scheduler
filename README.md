# Work-Day-SchedulerGIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

This web application is planner with current day is displayed at the top of the calender with timeblocks for standard business hours.
The timeblocks for that day are color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. I can enter an event in the timeblock and click save button. The text is saved in the local storage. Lastly, the saved events stayed even when the page is refresh. This was done using HTML, CSS and javascript.
